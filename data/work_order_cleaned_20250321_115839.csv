The apartment window is stuck open, when trying to close it - it does not shut all the way, it stays cracked open. I don't want to try and force it shut as it seems there is something from stopping it to close fully. Could you please resolve this, I reached out prior regarding the window not being able to open all the way so it seems there is an issue with the window. 

Thank you!",,New,,T104,"Sajjad, Faisal A.",03/14/2025,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,No,Window

That would be fine, except there's no outlet in the closet to set up the modem and router. To get a round this, you have to run the fiber cable out through a crack above the closet door. This will cause the door (over time) to pinch, rub against, and sever the cable. Can we;
1. Drop an outlet inside the closet (best solution)?
2. Re drop the fiber outside of the closet?",,New,,603,"Borriello, Alexis B.",03/20/2025,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,No,Internet
