The apartment window is stuck open, when trying to close it - it does not shut all the way, it stays cracked open. I don't want to try and force it shut as it seems there is something from stopping it to close fully. Could you please resolve this, I reached out prior regarding the window not being able to open all the way so it seems there is an issue with the window. 

Thank you!",,New,,T104,"Sajjad, Faisal A.",03/14/2025,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,,,No,Window
